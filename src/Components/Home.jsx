            Ever wondered if there was some kinda Hinge yearly wrap up, just so
            you know how often you swiped left (or right) on those voice prompts
            ? <br></br>
            Well I wish Hinge could tell you but they dont.
            <br />I mean they do but who is really trying to parse through some
            Json data? <br></br> Ok üòè that last one was rhetorical, because
            that's exactly what we are doing.
          </p>{" "}

            p.s this is in no way affiliated with the Hinge guys, just hoping
            that they dont send a cease and desist.{" "}
